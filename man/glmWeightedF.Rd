\title{Adjusted statistical tests for assessing
differential expression.}
\usage{
glmWeightedF(
  glmfit,
  coef = ncol(glmfit$design),
  contrast = NULL,
  independentFiltering = TRUE,
  filter = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{glmfit}{a \code{\link[edgeR]{DGEGLM-class}} object,
usually output from \code{\link[edgeR]{glmFit}}.}

\item{coef}{integer or character vector indicating which
coefficients of the linear model are to be tested equal to zero.
Values must be columns or column names of design. Defaults to the
last coefficient. Ignored if \code{contrast} is specified.}

\item{contrast}{numeric vector or matrix specifying one or more
contrasts of the linear model coefficients to be tested equal to zero. Number of rows must equal to the number of columns of \code{design}. If specified, then takes precedence over \code{coef}.}

\item{independentFiltering}{logical, specifying whether independent
filtering should be performed.}

\item{filter}{vector of values to perform filtering on. Default is
the mean of the fitted values from glmfit.}

\item{ZI}{logical, specifying whether the degrees of freedom in the
statistical test should be adjusted according to the weights in the
\code{fit} object to account for the downweighting. Defaults to TRUE and this option is highly recommended.}
}
\description{
This function recycles an old version of the
\code{\link[edgeR]{glmLRT}} method that allows an F-test with
adjusted denominator degrees of freedom to account for the
downweighting in the zero-inflation model.
}
\note{
This function uses an adapted version of the \code{glmLRT}
function that was originally written by Gordon Smyth, Davis
McCarthy and Yunshun Chen as part of the edgeR package.
Koen Van den Berge wrote code to adjust residual degree
of freedoom and added the independent filtering step.
