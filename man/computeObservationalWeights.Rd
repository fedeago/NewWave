\title{Observational weights of the zero-inflated negative binomial model for each entry
in the matrix of counts}
\usage{
computeObservationalWeights(model, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{the nb model}

\item{x}{the matrix of counts}
}
\value{
the matrix of observational weights computed from the model.
}
\description{
Given a matrix of counts, this function computes the
observational weights of the counts under a zero-inflated negative binomial
(NB) model. For each count, the NB distribution is parametrized by three
parameters: the mean value and the dispersion of the negative binomial
distribution, and the probability of the zero component.
