Title: Negative binomial model for scRNA-seq
Version: 1.1.2
Authors@R: c(person("Federico", "Agostinis", role = c("aut", "cre"),
                    email = "federico.agostinis@outlook.com"),
             person("Chiara", "Romualdi", role = "aut"),
             person("Gabriele", "Sales", role = "aut"),
             person("Davide", "Risso", role = "aut"))
Description: A model designed for dimensionality reduction and batch effect
    removal for scRNA-seq data. It is designed to be massively parallelizable 
    using shared objects that prevent memory duplication, and it can be used
    with different mini-batch approaches in order to reduce time consumption.
    It assumes a negative binomial distribution for the data with a dispersion
    parameter that can be both commonwise across gene both genewise.
